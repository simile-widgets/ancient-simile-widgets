<h1>Page Unavailable</h1>
<div class="message">
 <p>The service that I depend on for creating this page is currently
 unavailable, which is a polite way to say that it's probably screwed
 or that system administrator that manages me is taking a nap
 while the thing collapsed.</p>
 <p>Hey, look: I know it's not exactly professional to blame it on
 somebody else but this isn't my fault, ok? I tried. Believe me, I tried
 but nobody is listening overthere, so what can I do?</p>
 <p>I'm so sad: I'm never going to be a good server. You probably now think 
 that I won't be able to serve you any other page so you will go somewhere else.
 And you will not come back and I will feel even more useless.</p>
 <p>Why did I quit video-game school? :-(</p>
